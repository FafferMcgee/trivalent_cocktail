# Computational models of S0_2 designs
Selected computational models of S0_2 designs are provided in this [folder](./pdbs). To further diversify the sequence space by amino acids not explored by Rosetta, additional sequences were ordered with position 32 mutated to Phe. After PCR amplifcation of the oligo pool, transformation in yeast, selection under low stringency conditions and NGS, we found that the sequences were, on average, 87% identical (ranging between 63% and 100% sequence identity), likely explained by recombination events, PCR amplification biases and synthesis errors. The sequences that were found to be enriched, along with the enrichment values, can be found [here](./S0_2_enrichments.csv)
