# Template-free design of epitope-focused immunogens using TopoBuilder

To overcome the limitation of being dependent on design templates found in the natural protein repertoire, we developed a template-free design approach for the de novo design of functional proteins, named TopoBuilder. 

Within this repository, we present the design process for the design of site 0 and IV epitope-focused immunogens, starting from the backbone building using TopoBuilder, the Rosetta folding and sequence design process using [FunFolDes](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006623), followed by the analysis and selection of sequences for experimental testing all the way to the analysis of a high-throughput screen. 

For installing TopoBuilder and instructions how to use it in general, please go through our dedicated [TopoBuilder repository](https://github.com/LPDI-EPFL/topobuilder/tree/releasepy2). Within this repo, you can find the input and output files and scripts to reproduce the design process for [site 0](./S0_2) and [site IV](./S4_2).
